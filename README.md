# Machine Learning A-Z
Personal machine learning workspace based on [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfWB0Aed1dXR3g=/) Udemy course.

The course teaches machine learning using both Python and R programming languages, but since I prefer Python and being able to use Python in the first place, so additional code files within this repository will be written in Python.
